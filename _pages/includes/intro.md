# 👨‍🎓 Introduction
I am a Ph.D. Candidate at [the School of Vehicle and Mobility](https://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/) and [the State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Green Vehicle and Mobility](https://www.ase.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). My doctoral research topic is " Research on Learning-Based Powertrain Optimization and Energy-Saving Control Methods for Fuel Cell Commercial Vehicles", jointly supervised by [Prof. Zhi Wang](https://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/essay/74/1854.html), [Prof. Zunyan Hu](https://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/essay/74/1936.html), and [Prof. Hong Wang](https://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/essay/80/1823.html).

My research interests include the design and application of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, the development and optimization of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and energy management strategies (EMSs) for new energy vehicles, and the control of distributed energy storage systems.

Relevant control systems I have worked on have been applied in major automotive companies such as [BYD Auto](https://www.byd.com/us), [Dongfeng Motor](https://www.dongfeng-global.com/), and [SAIC Motor](https://www.saicmotor.com/english/index.shtml), as well as emerging automotive enterprises like [Hybot](http://www.hybot.com.cn/). I have published over 20 peer-reviewed journal and conference papers and am a co-inventor on more than 10 patents.
