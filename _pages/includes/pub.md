- We proposed a theory-constrained neural network (TCNN) that integrates physical principles without sacrificing accuracy. A theory-guided filter ensures sub-module interpretability, and sub-networks are individually trained under theoretical constraints with a CNN-BiLSTM-MHSA architecture enhances overall accuracy. Results demonstrate significant improvements in fitting accuragy for fuel cell modeling.

- We designed a reinforcement learning-based energy management strategy (RL-based EMS) development toolchain that integrates advanced algorithms with high-fidelity vehicle models based on the General Optimal control Problems Solver (GOPS) platform, leveraging Python-MATLAB/Simulink co-simulation for agent training across Model-in-the-Loop (MiL), Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL), and Vehicle-in-the-Loop (ViL) stages. The proposed toolchain provides a robust foundation for real-vehicle applications of RL-based EMSs.

[**An Improved Co-Optimization of Component Sizing and Energy Management for Hybrid Powertrains Interacting With High-fidelity Model**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10185086) \\
**Nuo Lei**, Hao Zhang, Hong Wang, Zhi Wang \\
In *IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology*

- We proposed a novel co-optimization methodology that incorporates the high-fidelity model (HFM) of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). In addition, based on the Pareto optimization method, an adaptive non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) with chaos sequence (NSGA-CS) is proposed. These results suggest that the novel co-optimization methodology proposed in this paper is effective in optimizing the powertrain parameters and control strategies and can further promote the energy-saving potential of HEV/PHEVs.
